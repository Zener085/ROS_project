# ROS_project 
My project for IRos course in Innopolis University.
This is a simple project about creating r2d2 robot, which can be controlled by keyboard.

## Get started
To start this project you may have all installed packages, which is used here 
(see [Sources](#Sources))

Also, you may clone this repository to new [workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace)

So for opening gazebo with robot and controller it's required to write in console

```commandline
roslaunch r2d2_movement start.launch
```

Then it opens gazebo and robot. Use the console to control the r2d2. The controller has the same keys as
